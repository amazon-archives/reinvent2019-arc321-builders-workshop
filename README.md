# Re:Invent 2019 ARC321  Builders Workshop
## Enabling AWS PrivateLink with the AWS Cloud Development Kit
---
## Overview

AWS PrivateLink provides private network access to AWS services and your own SaaS-style services. In this solution, learn how to use the AWS Cloud Development Kit ([CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)) to create a reusable component that sets up a proxy layer for resources that donâ€™t natively support AWS PrivateLink.

You will need an AWS account to complete this soluton.  In this example, we will be using [Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/)  as our development enviornment.   If you would like to use a local development enviornment and need guidance with setting up permission, please refer to the [AWS CLI Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)


## Getting Started
If you do not have an existing Cloud9 environment go ahead and set one up following the [AWS Cloud9  Cloud Based IDE QuickStart](https://aws-quickstart.s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-cloud9-ide/doc/aws-cloud9-cloud-based-ide.pdf)  

Here is the architecture schema of what we want to achieve with CDK:  

![Proxy layer](architecture.png)  

We have: 
 * One VPC to configure. You can build a simple one here, for instance with a CIDR of 10.0.0.0/24  
 * Build a security group for your Fargate task. We will deal with a Squid process here, so please choose to open port 3128 on all private CIDR ranges (192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8).
 * Build your Docker image, using the Dockerfile you will have in the 'docker-image' directory (check [DockerImageAsset](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-ecr-assets.DockerImageAsset.html)).
 * Build an ECS Cluster
 * Prepare a FargateTaskDefinition and add a container with the image created with the DockerImageAsset component and port 3128
 * Grant the execution role of the FargateTaskDefinition with the ability to pull the docker image from the ECR registry of the DockerImageAsset component
 * Create a FargateService that will host our proxy layer application
 * Create a Network Load Balancer and attach to it a target group on port 3128 with 2 network listeners: one that will listen to port 80 and the other one to port 443.
 * Add the network target group you have created for your load balancer to your FargateService component
 * Add Fargate service autoscaling capabilities  
 
 Once you're ready to deploy,  
 * `npm run build`
 * `cdk bootstrap aws://[your_account_id]/us-west-2`
 * `cdk deploy`  
And we're done! You can now wait for the stack to be deployed.

Now we can create our VPC Endpoint Service configuration on the Network Load Balancer (using the CLI or [AwsCustomResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_custom-resources.AwsCustomResource.html)) and mount it as a proxy on any other VPC as described in the next section.

## Testing the solution  

Once the stack is deployed, run `aws ec2 describe-vpc-endpoint-services --query 'ServiceDetails[?Owner!=`amazon`]'` in order to get the endpoint Service name. From the AWS console, with this endpoint service name, you will be able to create a VPC endpoint to any VPC of your choice.

To test it with a private endpoint in a private VPC, connect to a private instance and do the following:
* `export http_proxy=vpce-xxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.vpce-svc-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.us-west-2.vpce.amazonaws.com:80`
* `export https_proxy= vpce-xxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.vpce-svc-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.us-west-2.vpce.amazonaws.com:443`
* `export NO_PROXY=169.254.169.254`  
And do something like `aws s3 ls s3://[name_of_one_of_your_bucket]` (considering the instanceRole of the instance has the right S3 policy of course)
